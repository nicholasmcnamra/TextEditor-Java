# TextEditor (java) Modifications

This is a simple text editor. Using it as a starting point, it needs a bunch of functionality additions.

## Additions

Things to add:

- find/replace text implementation
- when you exit, you must NOT lose un-saved changes
- add a new window, scrollable, with some editor help documentation in it.
- implement Word Wrap (yeah, look it up)
- add a font panel, so you can change the font you edit in.
  - make sure not only new files are in the new font, but existing windows too.
- add a way to print the current file.
- add a way to set the page in portrait or landscape mode
- Make your About Dialog snazzy!
